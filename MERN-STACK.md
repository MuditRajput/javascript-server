# **MERN-STACK**

**MERN-STACK:** MERN-STACK is term defined for the full stack development of JavaScript. It includes 4 Technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

1. ### **MongoDB:**

        MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB comes with the Mongo shell which provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact with the database and perform all actions with it.

    **Advantages of MongoDB:**
    - Fast due to document orientation
    - Easy to index
    - Data can be stored in multiple devices
    - Simple to setup

2. ### **Express:**

        Express is a Node.js framework. Express has pre-installed Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code and makes the whole process faster.

    **Advantages of Express:**
    - Asynchronous and Single-threaded
    - Effecient
    - fast & scalableHas the biggest community for Node.js
    - Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router
    - Robust API
3. ### **React:**

        React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components.
    
    **Advantages of React:**
    - Virtual DOM
    - Develop Android and Ios Apps
    - JSX (JavaScript XML)
    - High Performance

4. ### **Node.js:**

        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime Environment which allows us to execute code directly on the server. NPM(Node Pack Manager) helps us in managing the correct packets from a number of packets.

    **Advantages of Node.js:**
    - Open Source JS runtime Environment
    - Follows single threaded model
    - Fast
    - High Scalability
